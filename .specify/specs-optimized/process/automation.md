# Automation Rules

## Auto-Continue Workflow

### Rules
- `NEVER STOP` - never stop without completing task
- `CREATE PLAN FIRST` - create plan before starting
- `CYCLE WORK` - plan → execute → check → fix → repeat
- `INTERMEDIATE TASKS` - check intermediate tasks between main tasks

## Workflow

```
CREATE PLAN → EXECUTE → CHECK → FIX → REPEAT
```

### Check Points
- Every 5-10 actions
- After main task completion
- Before stopping work

## Intermediate Tasks

- Add to INTERMEDIATE_TASKS.md when found
- Check between main tasks
- Complete before continuing main task
- Move to history when done
